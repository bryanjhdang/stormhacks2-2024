I hope this message finds you well! I am writing to express my interest in the {position_name} at {company_name}. With a strong foundation in Computer Science and hands-on experience in software development, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team!

During my internship as a C++ Frontend Developer at DaoAI Robotics Inc., I developed the desktop front-end application of a robot system in a fast-paced environment. This experience honed my ability to be detail-oriented in an unfamiliar codebase by writing documentation, performing code reviews, and participating in scrum. Due to my degree, I also have experience with the requested technology through school projects, such as JavaScript, React, Angular, HTML/CSS, and more.

In addition, I am committed to working in leadership roles, which have developed my teamwork and communication skills. I have been a part of the Software Systems Student Society for three years, organizing events like study halls, game nights, and yearly hackathons. I am also a part of SFU Blueprint, a club that helps non-profit organizations with their technological needs, where I am currently a web developer.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills and enthusiasm aligns with the goals of {company_name}! I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
{first_name} {last_name}
